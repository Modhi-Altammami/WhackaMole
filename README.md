# Whack a Mole

Whac-A-Mole is an arcade game, originally known as Mogura Taiji (モグラ退治, "Mole Buster") or Mogura Tataki (モグラたたき, "Mole Smash") in Japan. A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, six, black mallet. Five holes in the play area top are filled with small, plastic, cartoonish moles, which pop up at random. Points are scored by, as the name suggests, whacking each mole as it appears. The faster the reaction, the higher the score.

If the player does not strike a mole within a certain time or with enough force, it eventually sinks back into its hole with no score.

Although gameplay starts out slow enough for most people to hit all of the moles that rise, it gradually increases in speed, with each mole spending less time exposed and with more moles exposed at once. After a designated time limit, the game ends, regardless of the player's score. The final score is based on the number of moles the player struck.
