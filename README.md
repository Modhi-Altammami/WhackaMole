# Whack a Mole

Whac-A-Mole is an arcade game, originally known as Mogura Taiji (モグラ退治, "Mole Buster") or Mogura Tataki (モグラたたき, "Mole Smash") in Japan. A typical Whac-A-Mole machine consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and display screen, and a large, six, black mallet. Five holes in the play area top are filled with small, plastic, cartoonish moles, which pop up at random. Points are scored by, as the name suggests, whacking each mole as it appears. The faster the reaction, the higher the score.
